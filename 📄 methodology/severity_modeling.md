# Severity Modeling and Logistic Growth Analysis

To model the progression and severity of COVID-19 infection trends in India, a logistic growth framework was employed. Logistic growth models are well suited for epidemic analysis as they capture the transition from early exponential growth to eventual stabilization.

The severity-based modeling approach focuses on estimating key parameters such as growth rate and inflection point. The inflection point represents a critical phase in epidemic progression where the rate of new infections begins to slow, providing valuable insight for public health planning.

By fitting logistic curves to cumulative case data, the model offers an interpretable mathematical representation of outbreak dynamics. This enables assessment of epidemic severity in terms of growth behavior rather than relying solely on raw case counts.

The adopted modeling strategy prioritizes interpretability and early trend recognition, making it particularly suitable for emerging infectious disease scenarios where uncertainty and data limitations are prevalent.

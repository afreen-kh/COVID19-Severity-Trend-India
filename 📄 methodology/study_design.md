# Study Design and Participants

This study adopts a retrospective, observational analytical design to examine early trends and severity patterns of COVID-19 infection in India. The analysis focuses on population-level epidemiological indicators rather than individual-level clinical outcomes.

National-level, time-series data related to confirmed COVID-19 cases were analyzed to characterize the temporal evolution of the outbreak during its early phase. The study emphasizes trend identification, growth behavior, and severity estimation through descriptive and mathematical modeling techniques.

Given the public health context of the pandemic, the study relies exclusively on aggregate data reported through publicly accessible sources. No personal identifiers, clinical records, or sensitive patient-level information were used or processed.

The primary objective of this design is to enable early situational awareness by identifying emerging patterns in disease progression, rather than long-term forecasting or intervention assessment.

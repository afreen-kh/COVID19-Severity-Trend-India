# Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted as a foundational step to understand the structure, distribution, and temporal behavior of COVID-19 case data in India. EDA enables early detection of trends, anomalies, and phase transitions in epidemic growth.

The analysis included examination of cumulative confirmed cases over time, weekly progression patterns, and derived growth indicators. Growth ratio and growth factor metrics were calculated to assess the rate of change in case counts and to identify periods of rapid escalation or deceleration.

Visual and descriptive techniques were employed to capture underlying epidemic dynamics without imposing strong parametric assumptions. This approach supports transparent interpretation of outbreak progression and informs subsequent severity-based modeling.

EDA results provided critical insights into early acceleration phases of infection spread and guided the selection of appropriate growth models for severity estimation.
